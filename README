xpulse is a rectangular visual cue of system-lag/freeze response,
located at the top-right corner of the screen by default or where
specified via the command options. The source code uses the X11
libraries to draw a borderless window on the desktop.

Just type 'make' in the source directory and copy the executable
where appropriate/preffered.
